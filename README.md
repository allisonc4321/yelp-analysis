# Yelp Dataset Analysis

For my final project for Stats 21 (Python and Other Technologies for Data Science), I worked in a team of 5 to analyze Yelp's Business Dataset. After performing an exploratory data anlaysis of the dataset and discussing with my team members, we decided to look at how attributes of restaurants affect their star ratings. I focused on analyzing the effect of having/not having WiFi would impact a restaurant's star ratings. To do so, I performed t-tests and created data visualizations to accompany my findings.
